Promises are a powerful feature in JavaScript that allow you to handle asynchronous operations in a more elegant and readable way. They provide a way to deal with the complexity of asynchronous code by using a more sequential and synchronous-like syntax.

## Usage

To use promises in your JavaScript code, you need to create a new promise object using the `Promise` constructor. The promise object represents the eventual completion (or failure) of an asynchronous operation and provides methods for handling the result.

Here's a basic example of using a promise:
