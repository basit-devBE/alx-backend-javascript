# Node.js README

Welcome to the Node.js project! This README will provide you with an overview of Node.js and guide you on how to get started.

## What is Node.js?

Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment that allows you to build scalable and high-performance applications. It uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model, making it efficient for handling concurrent requests.

## Getting Started

To start using Node.js, follow these steps:

1. Install Node.js: Visit the official Node.js website (https://nodejs.org) and download the latest stable version for your operating system. Follow the installation instructions provided.

2. Verify Installation: Open your terminal or command prompt and run the following command to check if Node.js is installed correctly:

    ```
    node --version
    ```

    If the command returns the version number, you have successfully installed Node.js.

3. Create a Project: Create a new directory for your Node.js project and navigate into it using the terminal or command prompt.

4. Initialize a Node.js Project: Run the following command to initialize a new Node.js project:

    ```
    npm init
    ```

    This command will guide you through setting up your project and create a `package.json` file.

5. Install Dependencies: Use the `npm install` command to install any required dependencies for your project. For example:

    ```
    npm install express
    ```

    This command will install the Express framework.

6. Start Coding: You are now ready to start coding your Node.js application! Create a new JavaScript file (e.g., `app.js`) and write your code using the Node.js APIs or any installed libraries.

7. Run the Application: Use the following command to run your Node.js application:

    ```
    node app.js
    ```

    This command will start your application and make it accessible through the specified port or URL.
